# Sport Games schedule

### Goal: 
The project aims to allow anyone to create a quick schedule for sports team. I am interested because I have not seen a lot of program dedicated to provide a convenient way to create a schedule for sport games.

### User Stories:

#### Phase 0 & 1:
During Phase 0 & 1, the project wants to create a manager to hold information of a match between 2 teams.

- As a user, I want to be able to add players to team
- As a user, I want to be able to remove players from team
- As a user, I want to be able to add info of players as I create them.
- As a user, I want to be able to view info of each player.
- As a user, I want to be able to view who is on the team.
- As a user, I want to be able to view by sorting info of players in team. i.e. quick view by player position/ age
- As a user, I want to be able to update which team won.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my progress (if I so choose)
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my progress (if I so choose)

### Phase 4: Task 3

AppGUI is handling how many teams could be made, we could create an extra class, and have a list of teams instead.
This way the code would be easier to understand and the diagram would make more sense.
